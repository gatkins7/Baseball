# ⚾ The Price of Power: Home Runs vs. Strikeouts in MLB History

## 📌 Overview

This project investigates the relationship between **Home Runs (HR)** and **Strikeouts (SO)** among 465 of the top Major League Baseball players in history. The goal is to determine whether power hitters tend to strike out more, and what this means in the context of performance analysis and scouting.

Using real-world historical data, this analysis combines **correlation analysis** and **data visualization** to reveal meaningful patterns in baseball offensive stats.

## 📂 Dataset

- **Name**: `500hits.csv`
- **Source**: [Kaggle - 500 Top MLB Hitters Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/krupadharamshi/500hits)
- **Contents**: Career statistics of 465 top MLB players
- **Key Variables Used**:
  - `PLAYER`: Player name
  - `HR`: Total home runs
  - `SO`: Total strikeouts
  - (Optional: `BA`, `RBI`, `AB` for extended analysis)

---

## 📈 Key Result

- **Correlation (HR vs SO): `r = 0.763`**
  - This indicates a **strong positive correlation** — players who hit more home runs also tend to strike out more frequently.


## 💡 Interpretation

> Power comes at a cost — and that cost is strikeouts.

This project confirms the commonly observed baseball dynamic that elite power hitters often have high strikeout totals. This trade-off is increasingly accepted in modern baseball analytics.
